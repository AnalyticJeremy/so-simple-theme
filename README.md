# Any Means Necessary
## a data science blog by me, AnalyticJeremy

I wanted to make a blog so I'd have a place on-line to stash some of the various data analyses that I make in my spare time.  But who wants
to fool around with making a whole blog site somewhere?  So instead I'm just using my GitHub repository to store my blog.  And thanks to
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) I can make it look great!

I decided the blog would need a stupid name, and all the cool kids make some sort of statistics-related pun.  So my blog is called "Any Means Necessary"...
because, like, means are super important in statistics.
