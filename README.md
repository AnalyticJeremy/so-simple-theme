# AnalyticJeremy's Blog

I wanted to make a blog so I'd have a place to on-line to stash some of the various data analyses that I make in my spare time.  But who wants
to fool around with making a whole blog site somewhere?  So instead I'm just using my GitHub repository to store my blog.  And thanks to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
I can make it look great!
