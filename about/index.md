Hi!  My name is Jeremy Peach, and I'm a data scientist.  For my day job, I use my skills to acquire and analyze data for my clients so they can make better, more
informed decisions.  In my spare time, I apply those same skills to satisfy my own personal curiosity.

This blog gives me a platform to share these personal data analyses with the rest of the world.  Most will be frivilous, but some will be serious.  They all
reflect my desire to find some new insight in the data around us or to explore new data analysis techniques.
